Title:-Library Management System

Library management system is one that organizes and saves books’ information electronically to meet the needs of students.  

Both students and library managers benefit from the system, which allows them to keep track of all of the books available in the library at all times. Colleges must now keep a constant eye on the books they issue and return, as well as the transaction records. If this operation is completed manually, it will be time-consuming and prone to errors.

Enabling the system to maintain track of information including the date or borrowing, the date or book return, and even detailed book information eliminates the manual recording of this information and most importantly it reduced the risk of errors.

As a result, this method greatly lowers manual effort and allows for a seamless flow of library activities by eliminating the possibility of errors in the details.
